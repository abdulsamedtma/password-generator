## Description
The Random Password Generator is a web-based application built using JavaScript. It generates strong and random passwords that meet user-defined criteria.

Key features of this project include:

. Generation of random passwords with customizable length.
. Flexible password criteria, allowing you to specify the inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

**Motivation** 
The motivation behind creating the Random Password Generator project is to address the increasing need for strong and secure passwords in today's digital age. With the proliferation of online accounts and the ever-present threat of cyber attacks, having a strong password is essential to protect personal and sensitive information.

Many people struggle to create passwords that are both secure and memorable. Often, individuals resort to using weak passwords or reusing the same password across multiple accounts, which can lead to significant security vulnerabilities. By providing a simple and reliable tool to generate strong passwords, this project aims to encourage better password practices and enhance overall security.

The Random Password Generator project also serves as a learning opportunity for developers interested in web development or application programming. It demonstrates the use of programming languages, libraries, and best practices to create a functional and user-friendly password generator.

Ultimately, the goal of this project is to empower individuals with a tool that can generate strong, unique, and random passwords, ensuring the security and privacy of their online presence and digital assets.
